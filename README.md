My name is Ayman Sandouk.
I am a CS Masters student at the University of Rhode Island (URI).
My current research is creating a benchmarking tool to be used by researchers to benchmark LLMs (Large Language Models) and LLM Agents. I'm focusing on benchmarking LLM Agents for social fairness.
I am also a Teaching Assistant at URI. 
Currently teaching CSC 311 [Computer Systems & Programming Tools](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2025). Check it out!
