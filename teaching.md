As both an undergrauate TA and a Graduate TA I've had the pleasure of leading classes, labs and office hours which was 

Hosted office hours to explain complex concepts, assist with debugging, and support students learning new programming languages. Graded assignments and provided detailed, constructive feedback to help students strengthen their technical and conceptual understanding.
