As both an Undergraduate TA and a Graduate TA, I’ve had the pleasure of leading classes, labs, and office hours that emphasized hands-on learning and conceptual understanding. My approach focuses on helping students connect abstract ideas to practical implementation through guided exercises, debugging sessions, and detailed feedback.

I regularly hosted office hours to explain complex systems concepts, supported students as they learned new programming languages, and provided detailed, constructive feedback to help them strengthen their technical and conceptual skills.
