###### 🧠 About Me

I’m a computer scientist and educator working toward my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island (graduating May 2026). I spend most of my time at the intersection of AI systems, research infrastructure, and teaching. I love building tools that make research more transparent and reproducible, and I care a lot about helping people actually understand the technologies shaping the world around them.
My work tends to bridge research and education, everything from developing benchmarking systems for LLM‑based agents to creating open‑source training programs that help digital humanities scholars get comfortable with technical tools.

###### ⚙️ Technical Expertise

1. Programming: Rust, Python, Bash, C, C++, OOP, Functional Programming
1. Tools: Git, GitHub, SSH, MyST
1. Systems: Linux, SLURM, CUDA, HPC environments

###### 🧩 Research Interests

1. AI systems and Agents  
1. Reproducibility in ML
1. Open-source software for research
1. Human-AI collaboration and education
