###### üß† About Me

I‚Äôm a computer scientist and educator pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island (expected May 2026). My work sits at the intersection of AI research, systems, and education. I‚Äôm passionate about building tools and frameworks that make research more transparent, reproducible, and accessible to a broader community, AI systems, and helping others understand the technologies shaping our world. My work bridges research and teaching ‚Äî from developing LLM-agent benchmarking systems to designing inclusive open-source training curricula for digital humanities scholars.

I‚Äôve taught and assisted in computer science courses and workshops that introduce researchers to essential open-source tools and workflows. Whether I‚Äôm developing benchmarking systems for large language models or helping humanists learn Git and MyST, I strive to make complex technical ideas approachable, inclusive, and practically useful.


###### üíº Projects

Machine Learning for Socio-Technical Systems Lab (ML4STS), University of Rhode Island
As a software engineer, HPC researcher, and LLM-Agent maintainer, I contributed to developing a benchmarking framework for evaluating large language model agents in the context of fairness and reliability. My role involved implementing and maintaining agentic AI systems, managing batch scheduling with SLURM, optimizing CUDA-based computation, and contributing to a forthcoming research paper.
Skills: Python, HPC, SLURM, CUDA, AI Systems, Benchmarking, Research

Building Open Research Skills Infrastructure for Digital Humanities: Git, GitHub, and Beyond

University of Rhode Island & Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)
Developed and implemented an open-access training program to introduce humanities scholars and educators to essential open-source tools, including Bash, Git, GitHub, and MyST. Designed the curriculum using The Carpentries model for open-source curriculum development, which emphasizes inclusive pedagogy, and adopted Mozilla‚Äôs open-source community practices. Delivered hands-on workshops that prepared participants to collaborate and contribute to digital humanities projects using reproducible, transparent workflows.
Skills: Bash, Git, GitHub, MyST, Open Research, Curriculum Design, The Carpentries

###### üéì Teaching & Mentorship


As a teaching assistant and workshop facilitator, I focus on helping students and researchers bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. My approach is guided by inclusivity, openness, and curiosity ‚Äî ensuring that technical learning environments are welcoming, empowering, and built on shared discovery.

I believe teaching is an extension of research ‚Äî both aim to make knowledge accessible, replicable, and empowering.
