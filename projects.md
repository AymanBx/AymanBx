My work spans research, software development, and skill solving. Each project reflects a balance between engineering precision, curiosity-driven research, and a drive for practical problem solving.

Below are selected projects that showcase my experience across AI systems, data infrastructure, educational tools, and open-source software development. Each project page gives a brief look at its goals, methods, and outcomes.
