## Macro Assembler for the Rust Universal Machine (RUM)


Collaborated on developing a macro assembler in Rust for the Rust Universal Machine (RUM), a RISC-style virtual machine used in a Computer Science Machine Organization course to help students learn and understand low-level assembly concepts.

Designed and implemented an algorithm for linking multiple assembly source files into a single binary executable with relocation entries, enabling modular program composition.

As part of its educational use, the assembler includes template code blocks where students can implement key assembly instructions (e.g., add, subtract, load, store)â€”helping them engage directly with instruction set design and machine-level operations.


Skills: Rust, Assembly, Systems Programming, Linker Design, RISC Architecture, Binary Relocation
