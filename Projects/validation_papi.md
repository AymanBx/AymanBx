## Data Validation System for Medical Records

I built a system that checks structured data‑record files before they get sent out, making sure everything is formatted correctly and flagging any issues early. I set up JSON spec files to define all the validation rules, which helped keep different record formats consistent and reliable.

I wrote the validation logic in Python and then turned it into a REST API using MuleSoft Anypoint Studio, plugging it into an automated pipeline for data ingestion. The system caught a lot of the common formatting and compliance mistakes upfront, which really cut down on how many medical staff and student record files were getting rejected.

I also mentored a junior intern along the way, helping him plan their tasks and teaching him how to use Git and GitHub effectively so he could contribute confidently to the project.
