# Validation PAPI

## Data Validation System for Medical Records

Developed a robust system for validating structured data-record files and generating detailed error diagnostics before transmission to recipient systems. Designed specification files in JSON to define validation constraints and ensure data integrity across multiple record formats.

Implemented and tested the record validation algorithm in Python, then deployed it as a RESTful API on MuleSoft Anypoint Studio, integrating it into an automated pipeline for data ingestion and verification. The system proactively identified and filtered out common formatting and compliance errors, significantly reducing the rate of rejected files in medical staff and student record submissions.

Additionally, mentored a junior intern, managing their tasks and providing hands-on training in Git and GitHub workflows to support collaborative software development.
