## Collaborative Full-Stack Application (SCRUM Project)

I served as the SCRUM Master for a four‑person team building a full‑stack app, making sure our sprints stayed on track and everyone knew what they were working on. Most of my time went into keeping communication smooth, planning out tasks, and helping the team deliver features in steady, manageable chunks.

I also worked on the frontend, which we built using a UI tool that generates React Native code, and helped develop the backend with Firebase. We pulled in Firebase Authentication, the Realtime Database, and Cloud Functions to handle the core logic.

On the Cloud Functions side, I wrote and deployed a couple of key pieces: a JavaScript function that calculates Levenshtein distance between strings, and a Python function that formats and sorts data entries. I tested everything through Postman to make sure the functions behaved correctly and performed well.

For version control and project organization, we relied heavily on Git and GitHub Projects for tracking tasks, Issues for bugs, Wikis for documentation, and Pages for anything user‑facing. It made the whole workflow feel organized and transparent, which kept the team moving forward smoothly.
