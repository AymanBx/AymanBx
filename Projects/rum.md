# RUM

The Rust Universal Machine (RUM) is a 32-bit virtual machine built as part of a systems programming and computer organization course to explore the principles of abstraction, instruction design, and low-level computation. Developed in Rust, the machine executes a RISC-style instruction set and provides a foundation for understanding how high-level code translates into machine-level operations.  

As part of the project, we implemented and optimized the machine’s core functions, including instruction decoding, memory operations, and control flow, and conducted benchmarking to measure performance and identify efficiency improvements. This hands-on work offered deep insight into system-level design and performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between hardware architecture and software execution.
