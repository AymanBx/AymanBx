## Rust Universal Machine (RUM)

I built a 32‑bit virtual machine in Rust as part of a machine organization course, basically a small RISC‑style computer you can run in software. It was a great way to see how all the abstract ideas we talk about in class, like instruction sets and low‑level computation, actually play out when you implement them yourself.

We spent a lot of time getting the core pieces right: decoding instructions, handling memory, managing control flow, and then tuning things to run efficiently. We also benchmarked the whole system to figure out where it slowed down and how to make it faster.

Working on it really clarified how high‑level code eventually becomes machine‑level behavior, and how many trade offs go into designing systems that are both correct and fast. It was a hands‑on crash course in how hardware concepts and software execution meet in the middle.
