## Building Open Research Skills Infrastructure for Digital Humanities


I collaborated on putting together an open-access training program to help humanities scholars and educators get comfortable with core open‑source tools like Bash, Git, GitHub, and MyST. We built the curriculum using The Carpentries approach to teaching, which focuses on inclusive, hands‑on learning, we borrowed a lot from Mozilla’s open‑source community practices to make sure everything was accessible and welcoming.

I also co-ran the workshop where people could actually try things out, collaborate, and learn how to build digital humanities projects using transparent, reproducible workflows and utilize existing open sorce ones.

Seeing how open tools can connect technical skills with humanistic questions and how much difference inclusive, community‑driven teaching makes was genuinely energizing. It showed me how open technologies can make digital research feel more approachable for everyone.
