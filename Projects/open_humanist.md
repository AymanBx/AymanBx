## Building Open Research Skills Infrastructure for Digital Humanities

> University of Rhode Island & Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)


Developed and implemented an open-access training program to introduce humanities scholars and educators to essential open-source tools, including Bash, Git, GitHub, and MyST. Designed the curriculum using The Carpentries model and infrastructure for open-source curriculum development, which emphasizes inclusive pedagogy, and adopted Mozillaâ€™s open-source community practices for inclusive open source to ensure accessibility for all learners. Delivered hands-on workshops that prepared participants to collaborate and contribute to digital humanities projects using reproducible, transparent workflows.

It was inspiring to see how open technologies can bridge the gap between technical methods and humanistic inquiry, and how inclusive, community-driven training can make digital research more accessible to all.
