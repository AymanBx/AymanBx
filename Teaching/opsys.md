# Operating Systems

> Teaching Assistant - University of Rhode Island

Led two C/C++ laboratory sections of 20 students each, guiding hands-on exercises that reinforced fundamental systems programming concepts including stack and heap memory, pointers, process management, multithreading, mutex locks, interprocess communication (IPC), and shared memory management.

Hosted office hours to clarify complex systems topics, assist with debugging, and help students deepen their understanding of concepts such as stack vs. heap, process scheduling, and memory management.
