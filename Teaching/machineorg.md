# Machine Organization

> Teaching Assistant - University of Rhode Island

Assisted in teaching the Machine Organization course, guiding students through low-level systems concepts such as assembly analysis, code profiling, and system building. Supported implementation of a 32-bit virtual machine, helping students connect abstract computer architecture principles with practical programming experience.

Hosted office hours to explain complex system behaviors, assist with debugging, and support students learning new programming paradigms. Conducted recitation sessions introducing the Rust programming language, where students explored iterators, abstractions, and memory safety concepts through hands-on examples.
