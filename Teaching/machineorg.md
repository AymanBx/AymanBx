# Machine Organization

> Teaching Assistant - University of Rhode Island

I helped teach the Machine Organization course, walking students through low‑level systems topics like assembly analysis, code profiling, and how to actually build and reason about system components. I also supported the class project where students implemented a 32‑bit virtual machine, which really helped them see how the abstract ideas from computer architecture show up in real code.

I held office hours where we dug into tricky system behaviors, debugged all kinds of issues, and worked through new programming paradigms together. I also ran recitation sessions introducing Rust, giving students hands‑on practice with things like iterators, abstractions, and Rust’s approach to memory safety. It was a great way to help them bridge the gap between theory and real systems programming.
