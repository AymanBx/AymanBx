# Computer Systems and Programming Tools

> Instructor - University of Rhode Island

I led the Computer Systems & Programming Tools course for a class of 30 students, helping them build a deep understanding of how programs run at the system level. We explored topics like Bash scripting, floating-point representation, remote server use, C program compilation and linking, version control with Git and collaboration workflows with GitHub all through a hands-on, problem-solving approach.

To make grading and feedback more efficient, I also designed a Python and Bash tool that automatically gathers information on open pull requests and related issues across student repositories. This tool improved the workflow for instructors and made managing collaborative student projects much smoother.
